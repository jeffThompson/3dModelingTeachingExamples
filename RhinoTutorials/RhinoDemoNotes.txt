RHINO DEMOS

[ lecture on terms for 3d CAD ]
01	CAD (computer aided drafting)
02	x,y,z axis
03	curves, surfaces, solids, meshes

[ box with arced corner and circle inside ]
01	New File (close existing if opens)
02	Basic setup (units, viewports, zoom and pan)
03	Ortho on
04	Draw a rectangle using polyline and grid
05	osnap settings
06	Snap to both midpoints, draw circle in the center of rect
07	Selecting objects, delete both
08	Draw same rectangle by typing values / rect (horiz then vert)
09	Construction lines (create new layer, change to it, draw lines in corner for arcs)
10	Draw arcs (choose start/end/radius version)
11	Trim tool
12	Join arc and lines into single curve
12	Using same const line, draw a circle at the ctr of arc
13	Draw vertical construction lines (up 5" and down 1") starting in Top view, switching to front/right
14	Extrude outer curves to solid base (down)
15	Change view to Ghosted
16	Notice the color is that of the layer
17	Make new layers (Solids), change obj layers (mention you could delete solid)
18	Choose all curves, extrude up (should have hole at circle)

[ figure-8 ]
01	Draw circle 10" diameter
02	Draw another inside at 6" dia
03	Select both, Transform > Copy (place so they intersect)
04	Use trim to make into figure-8
05	Select curves, Solid > Extrude Planar Curve > Straight
06	Change to Solids layer
07	Using osnap to get the same height as other object

[ rounding solid edges ]
01	Solid > Fillet Edge
02	Change radius to .25"
03	Select outer edges on rect to round
04	Repeat with radius of 1" on inner cylinder

[ chamfering edges ]
01	Solid > Fillet Edge > Chamfer
02	Set radius to .5"
03	Select all edges of figure-8

[ making a cup ]
01	Draw on top view (intentionally the wrong one)
02	Make side profile of cup using single polyline (straight side)
03	Turn on control pts, shift top edge so side is at angle
04	Select shape, Transform > Rotate
05	Select bottom corner of base
06	Select 2nd pt in right view (so we can rotate that dir)
07	Rotate 90ยบ using grid!
09	Select cup side
10	Extrude using Surface, Revolve
11	Start at bottom ctr, end up Z, 360ยบ angle
12	To fillet corners, click Surface > Fillet Surfaces...
13	Type in .25" for radius
14	Select one face (side) then 2nd (bottom)
15	Repeat for all edges (incl inside)

[ octagon with holes ]
01	Polygon tool (choose # holes = 8)
02	Center point with edge on grid line
03	Draw small circle near edge
04	Transform > Array > Polar...
05	Center is ctr of octo
06	# of items is 7 (we already have 1!)
07	First ref is ctr of circle
08	Second is the last pt you want an item (can be corner of octo)
09	Const line up and down
10	Extrude!

[ rendering basics ]
01	switch to Render view in Perspective viewport
02	render preview
03	render (note colors)
04	Render > Render Properties > Background Color...
05	Note how this appears in Render view but not others
06	Also note no cast shadow
07	Add "floor" plane with surface
08	Select object, Change object texture (Edit > Show Obj Properties or cmd+J)
09	Material, change to Object
10	Change gloss and reflection > Render Preview (reflects other objects!)
11	Change texture to a file, then render preview to see reflection AND texture
12	Change bump texture (note: may crash Rhino on older machines)
13	Turn texture and reflectivity off, add bump
14	Render to see finished version
15	Add a directional light inside cup
16	New layer for Lights, change color to white
17	Place directional light inside (not at bottom) and Render
18	Note the darkness - we overrode the main light
19	Add a large spotlight (ctr, width, start) then Render

[ export for 3d printing ]
01	Export as STL file
02	NetFabb
03	ReplicatorG
